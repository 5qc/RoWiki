# RoWiki
RoWiki is a wiki hosting service (wiki farm) hosted with coding app [Glitch](https://glitch.com). It is coded from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JS. It was created on March 26, 2021. This GitHub page is the template page. You can also view the wiki (on GitHub or the website) for information (about adding pages, etc.)!

The whole thing is within HTML, so you will need to create a new HTML document to make a new article.
