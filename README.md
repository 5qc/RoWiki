# RoWiki
RoWiki is a wiki hosting service (wiki farm) hosted with coding app [Glitch](https://glitch.com). It is coded from scratch with HTML and JS and was created on March 26, 2021. This GitHub page is the template page. You can also view the [documentation](https://rowiki-doc.glitch.me) for information (about adding pages, etc.)!

The whole thing is within HTML, so you will need to create a new HTML document to make a new article. There is also no login. To put this wiki onto your website, you can either [remix the project on Glitch](https://rowiki.glitch.me) or download ZIP on GitHub.
